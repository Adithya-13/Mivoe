## Introduction

Mivoe is a Movie Application for the people who lookin for the new movie, popular, top rated, upcoming, and now playing movie.

In this project, I use TMDB API, for details you can see [here](#tech-stack).

The challenge here is that I created a movie app only 2 days within the integration of the API, which is very challenging for me. To see what features I made, you can see [here](#features).

I, use BloC as my State Management, and also use Get Storage to store state on local device. To see what Dependencies I created, you can see [here](#dependencies).
